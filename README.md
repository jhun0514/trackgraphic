The site allows a user to register with email/password and then issues a token.

## I used Django to make a website with python3, so check your python version before you run this program.
How to check?

on command line:

    python3 --version

If this command does not work, you have to download python3 at "https://www.python.org/downloads/"

## You might need Django
How to download?

on command line:

    pip install django
  

## Run the program
Download my codes, then go to the directory that you downloaded
then,

on command line:

    python3 manage.py runserver
  

## Check the result
You should get a website that looks like **template.pdf**

Thank you.
